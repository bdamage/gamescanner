2007-09-10 version 5.1
---------------------
New features
* Support for using keyboard movment in the serverlist, it will now update player and rules list when moving the selection row.
* New filter added "No Bots" applies only for ETQW servers.
* Fixed so Ranked server filter only applies to ETQW serverlist.
* Added ranked icon into the serverlist.
* 3 new columns added into the serverlist: Punkbuster, Private server, Ranked. Which now can be sorted.
* Improvements when adding already exsisted server IP from combobox it will be set aas favorite.
* Fixed gametype filtering... this will be on-going improvments to support all games better.
* Automatic updater, hopefully this means that you don't have uninstall and then install the new version. 
* Player column also now shows number of bots (applies to ETQW only), this may change in a future release.

  Example for the Player column:
  10/24+(4)+Bots[3] 

  Description:
  10 = total number of players including bots
  24 = max players (usually excluding private slots)
  (4) = number of private slots
  [3] = number of bots 
  So basicly in example this means there are 7 human players and 3 bots on the server.

* Now Favorite (star) button also works to set a selected server to Favorite. To remove a favorite right click on the server then choose "Remove server from favorites".
* Changed registry run keys from HKLM to HKCU for future compatibility.

* When adding a favorite IP address from treeview it now redraws the list.
