Compiling
---------

Visual Studio 2008 has been used but should compile fine on VS2005 also.


After a compilation you need the files inside the redist folder.
You can copy them to Release or/and Debug folder.


Directories global vars
-----------------------

EXE_PATH - 

Contains executable path. NO data should be written into this path, as this fucks up Vista instead 
use SAVE_PATH.

Currently EXE, DLL and screenshot preview is read from this dir.




SAVE_PATH - 

Following command is used to retrieve the path: SHGetFolderPath(NULL,CSIDL_APPDATA,NULL,SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT,SAVE_PATH);

Files that should be stored into this path is:
log.htm (logging inforamtion)
config.xml
treeview.xml
*.servers     - saved server informaiton
ipcountry.dat - Country database (created with the gamescanner.exe file itself, it is a "simplifed" structure based file instead of an CSV file)



net.jpg??




Typical path under Vista:

C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\ETSV



TreeView XML layout:


game="2"     - Game index (points to ET, ETQW, Q3...COD etc)
value="0"    - Can be any kind of value for ie. Filter servers with lower Ping than 100
icon="74"    - Icon index 
expanded="0" - The node/item has childs member, this will remember if the user has expanded the node on the next start of ETSV.
type="2"     - If type is 28 then it is Global Ping item
state="0"    - State of the item if it is Checked or Unchecked.

action="1"  - If action is 1 then redraw list based on current game="?" index.  
	      If action is 8 then a GLobal filter Edit (ie Ping).
	      If action is 10 then it is a country item.


<Item name="Quake 3: Arena" value="0" icon="74" expanded="0" type="2" state="0" game="2" action="1">


XML tree logic is following when a user interaction has occured:
1. user clicks on an item function TreeView_GetSelectionV3 () is called
2. item is looked up and checks which ACTION value it has 
Typical ACTION could be:
 (a) redraw a serverlist and exit function (TreeView_GetSelectionV3 ).
 (b) filter modification for a game, see step 3
 (c) global filter setting changes, see step 4

3. depending on ACTION value then next function is called
4. and here is TYPE looked up depending of type value a filter change is being processed.
